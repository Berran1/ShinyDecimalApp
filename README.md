A small interactive app prepared for the Developing Data Products course on Coursera, part of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science course. 

I decided to run a decimal time converter - because really, within the constraints of my time for the class I couldn't do anything that is genuinely difference-making and impactful (and couldn't think of those things) so when a friend made me aware of .beats in the context of What3words, and I disappeared down the decimal time wiki-rabbithole, I thought: why not revel in the pointlessness and convert to times that pretty much nobody uses? Why not indeed...
